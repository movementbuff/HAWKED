# HAWKED
Literally just a clone of my BH config with some stuff toned down to not destroy graphic quality ( no ultra mega low texture settings )

Expect a less experimental config soon.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Press Windows Key + R and type %localappdata%\Hawked\Saved\Config\ then press enter.
  
- Copy the folder "Windows" to and save a Backup somewhere memorable.
- Leave your backups alone unless you seek to restore your previous settings. 

- Inside Windows folder ( %localappdata%\Hawked\Saved\Config\Windows ) replace your current "Engine.ini" with the file provided.
- After replacing, Right click "Engine.ini" and Select "Properties". Ensure that "Read Only" is ticked/enabled then hit Apply/OK if necessary.


- Finally, Use RTSS to cap Frame Rate at 120, 125, 144, 165, 180, 200, etc or use the in-game Frame Limiter to prevent the framerate from spiking and dipping  (RTSS is strongly preferred. It is free and simple to use)
I recommend testing each Frame Rate cap over several matches until you can decide on which is the most consistent during fights. I use 275 as my monitor is 280hz and I don't experience any (noticeable) frame drops with this cap. 

Currently using Back-edge Sync instead of ASYNC in RTSS.
