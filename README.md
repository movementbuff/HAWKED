# I have removed several entries in this config that would be deemed exploitable by devs. Now the only changes are performance based. Shadows are no longer deleted, lighting is no longered modified, fog and atmosphere effects are default, etc. 
Super Beta Config that I put together quickly by copying my BH config and tweaking some stuff. FPS will improve but plenty of the cvars in here may not have any impact in HAWKED, I don't know, I haven't tested it even remotely properly yet.

 I recommend to disable Low Latency mode in Nvidia Control Panel when using this config.

Literally just a clone of my BH config with some stuff toned down to not destroy graphic quality ( no ultra mega low texture settings )

Expect a less experimental config soon.

- Press Windows Key + R and type %localappdata%\Hawked\Saved\Config\ then press enter.
  
- Copy the folder "Windows" to and save a Backup somewhere memorable.
- Leave your backups alone unless you seek to restore your previous settings. 

- Inside Windows folder ( %localappdata%\Hawked\Saved\Config\Windows ) replace your current "Engine.ini" with the file provided.
- After replacing, Right click "Engine.ini" and Select "Properties". Ensure that "Read Only" is ticked/enabled then hit Apply/OK if necessary.


- Finally, Use RTSS to cap Frame Rate at 120, 125, 144, 165, 180, 200, etc or use the in-game Frame Limiter to prevent the framerate from spiking and dipping  (RTSS is strongly preferred. It is free and simple to use)
I recommend testing each Frame Rate cap over several matches until you can decide on which is the most consistent during fights. I use 275 as my monitor is 280hz and I don't experience any (noticeable) frame drops with this cap.



Currently using Back-edge Sync instead of ASYNC in RTSS.
